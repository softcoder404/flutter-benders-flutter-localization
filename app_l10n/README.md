## What is Internationalization and Localization

- Internationalization refers to the process of designing and developing an application in a way that allows it to be translatable for users from different languages and regions without requiring engineering changes.

- Localization refers to the process of adapting an internationalized application for a specific target locale or market.

Internationalization and localization often go way beyond just text translation. Different regions write dates differently and can have different phone number formats, addresses, measurement units, currencies, etc.

## The goal of this repository

- Internationalize an existing app on the starter branch
- Organize internationalized messages.
- Localize your the app to support English and French

NB: Internationalization is also referred to as i18n and Localization is referred to as i10n because if you take the first and last letter from Internationalization - you have nternationalizatio which has 18 letters. Same things for localization.
